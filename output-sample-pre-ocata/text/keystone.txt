Even when the mapping is enabled by using domain-specific drivers (`[identity] domain_specific_drivers_enabled`), any users and groups from the default domain being handled by LDAP will still not be mapped to ensure their IDs remain backward compatible. Setting this value to false will enable the new mapping for all backends, including the default LDAP driver. It is only guaranteed to be safe to enable this option if you do not already have assignments for users and groups from the default LDAP domain, and you consider it to be acceptable for Keystone to provide the different IDs to clients than it did previously (existing IDs in the API will suddenly change). Typically this means that the only time you can set this value to false is when configuring a fresh installation, although that is the recommended value.
